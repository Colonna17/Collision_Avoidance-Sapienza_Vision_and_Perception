 Sapienza Universty project for Vision and Perception class 2022. Students: Edoardo Colonna, Lapo Carrieri and Silverio Manganaro
# Abstract
Nowdays one of the hottest topic in AI area is autonomus driving. It heavily rely on new technologies from computer vision to achieve results that otherwise would not make possible to use self-driving cars. However, many improvements are still needed in this field. For instance, new ways of dealing with unforeseen conditions.
Our project aims to develop a method for for 2D/3D object detection in autonomous driving during adverse weather conditions. We'll start by comparing our results with actual benchmarks. Then, by using outputs from the first part of the work, we'll focus on estimate object orientation and velocity in order to generate a valid collision avoidance method, in line with current literature on the subject.
# Dataset
We'll base our work on DENSE (https://www.uni-ulm.de/en/in/driveu/projects/dense-datasets#c8116699), a dataset created "under all weather conditions" with multiple kinds of sensors. We'll also rely on CCD (Car Crash Dataset)(https://github.com/Cogito2012/CarCrashDataset) given its specialisation in traffic accident scenes.
